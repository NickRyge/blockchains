# Assignment 2
This one is straight forward with Truffle. The Ethereum network runs just fine on the PC with mining and all, by the way. 

Truffle is suprisingly easy to work with, and I just created a quick contract that allows for using msg.sender as the owner of their respective account. Is it intelligent? No. Am I intelligent? Yes.

Don't worry, I'll grow up some day.


By the way, did you notice I accidentally made the Assigment2 folder with a capital A? Whoops.
