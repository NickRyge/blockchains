# The blockchain assignments.

## Assignment 1
Updated with the first assignment. Using docker compose for the bitcoin core since I don't want that stuff installed on my PC. 

To acompany it I made a quick python script using the RPC server in the bitcoin core for RPC calls, instead of just the command line. I thought this was a more elegant solution.

## Assignment 2
- TO BE UPLOADED 
Using Docker for Ethereum was annoying due to bad documentation, and I have decided to ignore my previous statement and just installed GETH on my PC. So much for principles, but principles are abandoned in war.
